                     I am currently a Fourth-year student at TUS where I have been studying for a Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Software Design with Mobile Apps and Connected Devices. With hands-on experience in software development and a passion for problem-solving, I aim to contribute meaningfully to the IT industry. Skilled in Java, Python, and SQL, along with experience in project management and agile methodologies, I am eager to apply my technical skills and communication abilities to real-world challenges. Known for my enthusiasm, technical aptitude, and interpersonal skills, I thrive in collaborative environments and continuously seek to grow in my career. In addition, to my technical experience I have excellent interpersonal and communication skills having given multiple presentations at university throughout my four years as well as the skills I have learnt and improved upon in my internship with Ericsson.

                        <p>As part of the Ericsson INFUSE Project, I developed a full-stack web application demo tailored for young interns, aged 15-18.
                           This project aimed to introduce students to core concepts in web development and provide a hands-on experience in building
                           applications from scratch. My responsibilities included creating a user-friendly application and accompanying documentation,
                           along with step-by-step guidance to support participants through each stage of the development process. By presenting complex
                           topics in an accessible way, I was able to contribute to a learning environment that empowered interns to explore coding
                           fundamentals and gain confidence in their technical skills. This experience allowed me to refine my ability to communicate
                           technical concepts effectively and reinforced my commitment to inspiring the next generation of tech talent.

                         <p>Worked on software development as part of a placement internship, gaining hands-on experience and practical insights into the field.
                            As a Software Developer intern at Ericsson Athlone, I was immersed in a dynamic development environment that provided invaluable hands-on
                            experience in software design and implementation. Throughout my placement, I worked closely with a team of experienced developers, contributing
                            to real-world projects and gaining practical insights into the industry’s best practices and workflows. This role allowed me to sharpen my
                            technical skills, as I engaged with various stages of the software development lifecycle—from initial planning and coding to testing and
                            deployment. Additionally, I became proficient in collaborating within cross-functional teams, adapting to agile methodologies, and effectively
                            troubleshooting complex issues. This experience not only expanded my technical toolkit but also deepened my understanding of industry
                            expectations and the impact of innovative solutions in a fast-paced telecommunications environment.
